-- ME:
Hello, my name is Lucas Augusto. I am a developer with experience in Java and currently studying Python in my System Development course at Senac Tech. I’ve worked on several personal projects like a system for a car dealership, a hospital management system, and a program that calculates how many years, months, days, hours, and minutes you have lived.

I currently work at a real estate agency. My job is to add properties to the company's system and create sales and rental contracts.

My current goal is to build projects using Python, possibly porting the ones I've created to Java. I also want to learn C++ to help with emulator development and I want to work in software development.
