In the past, I had a DVD-VCR player. We (my family and I) had CDs and VHS tapes with movies on them, like The Lion King. We would insert the CD or VHS tape into a device that was connected to the TV and then the device would play the movie and we would watch it together. Now, I don't use CDs and VHS tapes anymore, I use streaming apps like Netflix, Max, Amazon Prime. I just turn on the TV, go into the app and the movies are there. I select one and watch it.

I use tech since i was three. In my trajectory: I played games on a Desktop PC, I watched movies using VHS and CDs, I had an account on Orkut and MSN, I played video games like Playstation One, Playstation two and SNES (Super Nintendo). Now, I have an account on Instagram and Twitter, and I watch movies and listen to music via streaming
